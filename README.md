## About Project
### Product Vision
For educational institutions looking to boost academic performance, Academic Dashboard is a web application that improves how students interact with course-related work assigned by professors. Unlike other similar products that are uniquely designed for a single institution, our software product was built to be adopted across different campuses and to provide a sense of familiarity to all students. Its built-in calendar, checklist, and reminders allows user to become more organized without the need to switch applications.
